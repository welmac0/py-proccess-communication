### Execution
In order to execute program you have to type into terminal:  
`python program_b.py`

### What
Program A: Pseudo-Random Number Generator
Program A will act as a pseudo-random number generator.
It reads commands from stdin, where each command is delimited by a line break,
and writes responses to stdout. The program should handle the following commands:
Hi: Responds with "Hi" on stdout.
GetRandom: Responds with a pseudo-random integer on stdout.
Shutdown: Gracefully terminates the program.
Any unknown commands should be ignored.

Program B will launch Program A as a separate process, provided as an argument. Once Program A is running, Program B should:
Send the Hi command to Program A and verify the correct response.
Retrieve 100 random numbers by sending the GetRandom command to Program A 100 times.
Send the Shutdown command to Program A to terminate it gracefully.
Sort the list of retrieved random numbers and print the sorted list to the console.
Calculate and print the median and average of the numbers.

### Why
Project made for the sake of applying on JetBrains Internship. However, I didn't make it.
